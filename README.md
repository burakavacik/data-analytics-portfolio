-- Example 1: Create a simple Customers table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    JoinDate DATE
);

-- Example 2: Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, City, JoinDate)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'San Francisco', '2023-01-15');

-- Example 3: Query data with filter and sorting
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City
FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'San Francisco'
ORDER BY JoinDate DESC;

-- Example 4: Aggregate query
SELECT City, COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY TotalCustomers DESC;
